**BINARY ARCHITECTURE**
note: "block = a chunk of bytes with an allocated size"

block #     block               type                            purpose

--          blocks              uint32_t                        counts the number of blocks (not including blocks 0-2)
--          block sizes         multiple uint32_t's             shows the size of all the blocks from block 3 and on in bytes.
--          config size         uint32_t                        shows the size of all the configuration data.

0           1 x bias layer      1 float 32 for each bias        holds the biases, there can be as many of these as needed
1           1 x weight layer    1 float 32 for each weight      holds the weights, there can be as many of these as needed
2           1 x bias layer      1 float 32 for each bias        holds the biases

keep weights on every odd block number, and biases on every even block number
