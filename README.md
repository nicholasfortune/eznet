# What is EzNet?
EzNet is a **CPU-based neural network library** written entirely in C++, with the following key features::
- A **public API** for integrating neural networks into your own programs.
- An optional command-line interface *(CLI)* for creating, training, and testing networks **from the terminal**.
- A custom built-in network binary format capable of reading and writing **billions of 32-bit floats** at lightning fast speeds.

You can use EzNet through the library for full programmatic control, or through the CLI for quick experiments or to create prebuilt networks to embed in your projects.
